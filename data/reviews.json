At no point at all could I feel in any way connected to any character in the film or even feel anything for them. Be it love or hate. I could only feel sorry for them for having to act in such a bad movie. If you have a bit of taste, it's practically unwatchable. When Ving Rhames and his son say their I love yous just before or after Rhames executes some former associate of his... you can just roll your eyes at the amateur-like writing and directing. Enough is enough. Make up your own mind. But don't say I didn't warn you.","rating":"1","timestamp":1691268155},{"id":"75bbd36d025c7b4d6096468898f19418","videoId":"22","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"John Travolta should stick to dancing.","rating":"4","timestamp":1667994946561},{"id":"c4fb4bb7545c36d35adc028860db6865","videoId":"32","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"Genuinely Awful","rating":"3","timestamp":1668076620642},{"id":"247bbd09ccd0ae9df1e9909ac9e93306","videoId":"2","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"Not as fun as it should have been","rating":"6","timestamp":1668082121753},{"id":"0e067b197bc71114d3bf8aee2175fd79","videoId":"22","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"Just awful","rating":"1","timestamp":1668084314390},{"id":"220ecd1398380c6a4e8c9b79a19df57a","videoId":"32","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"This made me actually like the original movies","rating":"7","timestamp":1668086160233},{"id":"fe8d2a03c74e9cf98b0ddbc251f14edb","videoId":"8","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"Better than the book","rating":"7","timestamp":1668094168989},{"id":"7877ecd34a5bb560e53baee1fe126f73","videoId":"27","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"Nice visuals","rating":"10","timestamp":1668094222706}]
