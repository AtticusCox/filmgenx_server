At no point at all could I feel in any way connected to any character in the film or even feel anything for them. Be it love or hate. I could only feel sorry for them for having to act in such a bad movie. If you have a bit of taste, it's practically unwatchable. When Ving Rhames and his son say their I love yous just before or after Rhames executes some former associate of his... you can just roll your eyes at the amateur-like writing and directing. Enough is enough. Make up your own mind. But don't say I didn't warn you.","rating":"1","timestamp":1691268155},{"id":"75bbd36d025c7b4d6096468898f19418","videoId":"22","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"John Travolta should stick to dancing.","rating":"4","timestamp":1667994946561},{"id":"c4fb4bb7545c36d35adc028860db6865","videoId":"32","name":"Atticus Cox","content":"Genuinely Awful","rating":"3","timestamp":1668076620642}]
